## About Me

I’m a cybersecurity student with a strong interest in securing cloud infrastructure and detecting vulnerabilities before they become breaches. With hands-on experience in AWS, vulnerability scanning, and automation, I’m preparing for a career as a Cloud Security Engineer or Security Analyst.

## Current Project

### Vulnerability Scanner Lab  
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/abrahamgo52/Vulnerability-Scanner-Lab/tree/main)  
- Built using Kali Linux, Nmap, Nikto, and OpenVAS  
- Explores basic vulnerability scanning and target enumeration in a virtualized environment  
- Documents identified CVEs with sample remediation reports

## Upcoming Cloud Security Projects

### IAM Misconfiguration Lab  
Simulate AWS IAM misconfigurations and privilege escalation scenarios. Remediate permissions to enforce least privilege and track changes via CloudTrail.

### Secure S3 Bucket Deployment  
Audit and secure misconfigured public S3 buckets. Enforce encryption, tighten access policies, and automate deployment using Python and AWS CLI.

### Cloud Security Posture Assessment  
Audit AWS environments using ScoutSuite and Prowler. Identify misconfigurations, map them to CIS Benchmarks, and document remediation strategies.

### Infrastructure as Code Security (Terraform + tfsec)  
Deploy secure AWS infrastructure using Terraform. Integrate security tools like tfsec and checkov to identify risks in IaC templates.
